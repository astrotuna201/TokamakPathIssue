# TokamakPathIssue

A small demonstration project (swiftpm) exploring Path issues in Tokamak.
This project builds natively via `swift run`, or as Web App via `carton dev`.

The subdirectory Assets shows different renderings from Native, Safari, 
Firefox + Chrome. All Tokamak-based browser versions displace the Path line.
